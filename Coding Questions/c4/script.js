/*Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
Your tasks:
1. Calculatethetip,dependingonthebillvalue.Createavariablecalled'tip'for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement 😅 (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)
2. Printastringtotheconsolecontainingthebillvalue,thetip,andthefinalvalue (bill + tip). Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25”
Test data:
§ Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430 Hints:
§ To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2 § Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's>= 50 && <= 300😉*/

const bill = 40;

const tip = bill >= 50 && bill <= 300 ? 0.15 * bill : 0.2 * bill;

const totalValue = bill + tip;

console.log(`The total bill was ${bill} and the tip on this bill is ${tip}  and the total value ${totalValue}`);
