/*Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new gymnastics discipline, which works differently.
Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so one average score per team).
A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team. Otherwise, no team wins!
Your tasks:
1. Createanarrowfunction'calcAverage'tocalculatetheaverageof3scores
2. Usethefunctiontocalculatetheaverageforbothteams
3. Createafunction'checkWinner'thattakestheaveragescoreofeachteam
as parameters ('avgDolhins' and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the winner to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above. Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)"
4. Usethe'checkWinner'functiontodeterminethewinnerforbothData1and Data 2
5. Ignoredrawsthistime
Test data:
§ Data 1: Dolphins score 44, 23 and 71. Koalas score 65, 54 and 49 § Data 2: Dolphins score 85, 54 and 41. Koalas score 23, 34 and 27
Hints:
§ To calculate average of 3 values, add them all together and divide by 3
§ To check if number A is at least double number B, check for A >= 2 * B.
Apply this to the team's average scores 😉*/
